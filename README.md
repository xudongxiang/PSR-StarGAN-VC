## > Converted speech of PSR-StarGAN-VC
* This repository stores converted speech of PSR-StarGAN-VC. If you want to get more details of PSR-StarGAN-VC, please [contact](https://github.com/xudongxiang) me, and we welcome any feedback.  
* In order to show that advantages of PSR-StarGAN-VC are not highlighted by deliberately lowering the performance of StarGAN-VC, we hope to accept public review by directly comparing our method with public demo of StarGAN-VC or StarGAN-VC2, which can get in StarGAN-VC2. The order of our converted speech is the same as StarGAN-VC's. We select the same speaker as they select. Experiment are carried on four speakers (SF1, SF2, SM1, and SM2) following the two systems again.
